# Bash and Git

A presentation on the Bash shell and the Git revision control system.

## Intended audience

Experienced software developers. You've used several programming/markup
languages. You regularly design, write, debug, test, and deploy software.

You're a whiz at your IDE, but you haven't had to slum it on the command
line often.

## Prerequisites

Think of this as Bash 102, Git 102. That is, one class past the most basic
introduction.

For "Git 101", see slides 1 through 11 in
[this presentation](http://git-intro.redhoterlang.org/).
